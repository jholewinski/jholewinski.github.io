<h3>Additional information explaining the grading plan</h3>

<h4>Sprint0</h4>
<p>An individual lab assignment using the same development environment used for the team project.
</p>

<h4>Sprint1</h4>
<p>This ungraded activity is an opportunity to get feedback on the use of documentation and code management tools that will be used as part of the team project.</p>

<h4>Sprints2-5 (i.e. the team project)</h4>
<p>This subjective grade takes into account:
the functionality of your team's project, 
the code quality of your team's projects, 
the processes your team followed during development,
and your individual level of contribution to the project 
(as determined by peer reviews and observations from the instructor and grader; in cases where peer review data is deemed inaccurate, the contents of the team's code commit logs will also be considered).
Improvement (or regression) over the semester can also factor into this score.
Throughout the semester you will be provided with feedback on these elements, use the information to determine which areas, if any, to improve upon.
</p>

<p>
In most cases, individual scores on the project are based on the team scores, then delta'd up or down based on individual performance.
Up for students regularly rated as contributing above or near the team's average ratings on the peer reviews.
Down for students regularly rated as contributing below the team's average ratings on the peer reviews.
In extreme cases, the instructor may grade students on those teams individually. 
An example of an extreme case: a team member not contributing any code for two sprints (i.e. half of the team project) 
is likely to earn less than 50% for their project score regardless of how good their team's end result is.
</p>
<p>
Scores for Sprints2-5 will be posted on Carmen near the end of the semester using the following terms and formulas:<br>
Individual Evaluation (abbreviated as I) – a value between 0 and 100 representing your individual performance in the course, as described earlier.<br>
Team Evaluation (abbreviated as T) – a value between 0 and 100 representing your team’s performance on the project, 
primarily based on the feedback you’ve received from your graders and my code quality write-ups, 
but also a small amount based on the presentation and work demoed at the end of the course.<br>
Formula for the reported value: ( ( I * T ) + ( ( I + T ) / 2) ) / 2<br>
<ul>
<li>Why this formula? It is the average of expressions that, when used alone, typically underestimate or overestimate fair scores.
<li>The product ( I * T ) is an underestimate in most cases, ex: using a B rank for each term is 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225, which is a C-.
<li>The average ( I + T ) / 2 is an overestimate for "free riders", ex: if someone did average work on 2 of the sprints but was completely absent on the other half of the project, 
and their team earned an A+ despite this detriment the average could be: (40 + 100) / 2 = 0.70 which is a C-.
<li>This reported value is not necessarily your final score on the project, but it should be close (i.e. within +- 5%) to it unless you had extremely high or low individual peformance.
