to say I enjoy it very much!  But one default setting  that tripped me up (as
set by &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;i3-config-wizard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) was the key bindings for workspace switching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1
bindsym $mod+2 workspace 2
bindsym $mod+3 workspace 3
# ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works well until you start naming your workspaces. With these bindings,
you will switch to workspace &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, not &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;.  So if you rename
workspace 1 to &amp;quot;1: Firefox&amp;quot; and press Mod5+1, you'll end up opening a new
workspace instead of going to the &amp;quot;1: Firefox&amp;quot; workspace.  Not very intuitive!
Luckily, we can easily get the desired behavior with a slight tweak to the
config file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;bindsym $mod+1 workspace number 1
bindsym $mod+2 workspace number 2
bindsym $mod+3 workspace number 3
# ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

dabbled with the various preview versions, but now it's time to try the
released version. &amp;nbsp;I've read the reviews, saw the mixed reactions to the
new &amp;quot;Modern UI&amp;quot;, and decided to see for myself how I feel about
it.&amp;nbsp;Generally speaking, I don't mind the new interface. &amp;nbsp;My usual method
of launching a program was pressing the Win key, typing the first few
letters of the application name, and then hitting Enter. &amp;nbsp;Still works in
the Start Screen. &amp;nbsp;Start Menu vs. Start Screen, it doesn't bother me.
&amp;nbsp;Except for one little detail...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;... the complete lack of multi-monitor support in the Modern UI!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, there can only be one full-screen Modern UI app displayed at
a time. &amp;nbsp;So if I open, say, Mail on one screen and attempt to open Maps
on another screen, the screen showing Mail will go back to the desktop.
&amp;nbsp;To make matters worse, the Start Screen counts as a Modern UI app in
this regard. &amp;nbsp;If I have Mail open on one screen and try to open the
Start Screen on another screen to launch an application, the screen
showing Mail goes back to the desktop and I have to alt+tab back to it.
&amp;nbsp;Talk about a disruption in my workflow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention my main desktop is triple-head? &amp;nbsp;It comes in handy for
coding. &amp;nbsp;All of the Windows 8 reviews I read talk about the pros and
cons of the new Modern UI, but I rarely see any reference to the
complete lack of multi-monitor support in it. &amp;nbsp;I'm not sure if this is
just a feature oversight, or a more fundamental limitation in the model
used for WinRT apps. &amp;nbsp; Is there a fundamental technical limitation in
the operating system that prevents multiple Modern UI apps to be visible
at the same time? If the Modern UI is the future, I sure hope they get
this fixed ASAP! &amp;nbsp;For now, it's easy enough to just avoid Modern UI apps
altogether, but what happens in the future when I find an app I want to
keep open on one of my screens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more disturbing, this is becoming a trend in mainstream
operating systems. &amp;nbsp;While Windows 8 has this limitation for Modern UI
apps, full-screen apps in Mac OS X are not really any better. &amp;nbsp;If I
full-screen an application in a multi-monitor configuration, I get that
app on one monitor and a pretty background on all others. &amp;nbsp;I would much
rather have the ability to put multiple apps in full-screen mode
side-by-side, or perhaps have the option to have a full-screen app next
to a desktop workspace on another monitor. &amp;nbsp;At least I can have multiple
workspaces, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I'm just too adjusted to my Linux multi-monitor
configurations...&lt;/p&gt;

10.7, so your mileage may vary with this method. &amp;nbsp;This was written when
10.7 was brand new and most software was not yet updated for it.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that do not know, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net"&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent Python
plotting library that allows you to create professional-quality plots
for inclusion on web pages, Latex documents, Beamer presentations,
Keynote presentations, and any other software that can import SVG, EPS,
PNG, or virtually any graphic format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, getting matplotlib installed on Mac OS X 10.7 can be a bit
tricky, especially if you are using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; as your &amp;quot;package
manager.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;First off, Homebrew does not have packages for matplotlib, as
well as some of its dependencies. &amp;nbsp;Additionally, the current Matplotlib
release version (1.0.1 as of this post) does not compile out-of-the-box
against libpng 1.5, which is included in the X11 distribution shipped
with Mac OS X 10.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For previous versions of Mac OS X (10.6, 10.5), the usual way to install
matplotlib was to install python, pkg-config, and gfortran with
Homebrew, then install numpy and matplotlib through pip, ala:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ brew install python
$ brew install gfortran
$ brew install pkg-config
$ easy_install pip
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install matplotlib
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as previously mentioned, all is not so easy in the world
of Mac OS X 10.7, and the difficulty lies with libpng 1.5, installed
with Mac OS X 10.7's version of X11. Briefly put, Matplotlib 1.0.1 is
not compatible with libpng 1.5 due to a change in the API. Fortunately,
the fix is already applied up-stream and will probably be a part of
Matplotlib 1.0.2, or 1.1.0, or whatever the next released version is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the next release, the Matplotlib sources in Git can be used.
Instead of pulling the sources from the Matplotlib SourceForge site, you
need to pull them from the Matplotlib GitHub site. I'm not sure if this
GitHub site is &amp;quot;official,&amp;quot; but is looks to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is needed is to build Matplotlib from source instead of using
pip, so the installation procedure is now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ brew install python
$ brew install gfortran
$ brew install pkg-config
$ easy_install pip
$ pip install numpy
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git
$ cd matplotlib
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you're good to go! Hopefully this will become much easier with
the next official release of Matplotlib.&lt;/p&gt;
