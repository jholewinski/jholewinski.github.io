I've converted my old Space Hogs game project to XNA 4.0 (it was originally
written in XNA 1.0). There were enough API changes to make it a pain, but I
think I have everything working now.

This game was developed by myself, Jason Kim, Joseph Ahn, Vjekoslav Kovacevic,
and Daniel Guinn for a computer animation class during Winter Quarter 2007.

You can find a zip file [here](/binaries/SpaceHogs.zip). This requires XNA 4.0
and the February 2010 DX packages to be installed on your machine. For
convenience, I've included both of the redistributable packages in the zip file.

Enjoy!
