# Introduction

This is a Junior-level (or advanced Sophomore) course on professional software
development. Our goals are to craft high-quality software, understand the
process of Agile software development, survey design patterns, become familiar
with advanced tools for software development and project management, and
experience working in a small team (sized 4-6). To facilitate reaching these
goals, you will work on developing and refining a 2D game application over the
course of the semester. There will be a large amount of critiquing of code and
interactive feedback. This will lead to refinement and improvement of your
software for future expansion and maintenance.
