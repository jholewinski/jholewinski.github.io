My name is Justin Holewinski, and I am a compiler engineer at NVIDIA
working on compute compilers (CUDA/OpenCL).  Previously, I was a
Ph.D. student at the Ohio State University, studying compiler technology
and high-performance code generation for heterogeneous architectures.

In my personal time, I enjoy exploring high-performance code generation
for high-productivity, high-level languages.  Specifically, I enjoy
looking at high-performance compilation for game engines and game
scripting languages, including the graphics pipeline, physics
simulations, and shading.
